# Small Experiments
A key tenet of design thinking is iteration — testing early and often — and in a lean design process this means experimenting as cheaply as possible, building out ideas in their most distilled test-able form as small experiments to learn from. I'm a grad student; I've got to live my live like an underfunded lean startup, so small experiments are the way to go. Most of these are still just ideas. By posting them, I intend to publicly commit to building them out so my lists of ideas starts to become real.

## Nightmanif (link coming soon)
Rad party supplies, pins, patches and other (reusable, sustainable) ephemera.

## Untested Travels (link coming soon)
Remote travel design. Coming soon.

## yesimabitch (link coming soon)
Something in the music space. TBD. Coming soon.

## Tropicalia (link coming soon)
Print-at-home paper goods designed with a tropical aesthetic. An experiment both in visual design and in automated revenue streams.

# About Me (More Links)
I'm Allison, and I'm a San Francisco-based design strategist, with experience in UX/UI/product design, business strategy and user research. I'm passionate about social impact/change, anthropological theory, travel and sailing. Small Experiments is where I intend to gather my experiments in ventures, based on the idea of starting with 'small experiments' as prototypes to test out new ideas.

## Bigger Experiments
I hope to log the ideas that I've graduated from the relatively small experiments phase here; so far this lists arguably includes [Cohabit](http://www.allisonmarie.co/cohabit) and [TrainTrax](http://www.allisonmarie.co/traintrax-music-streaming-middleware).
